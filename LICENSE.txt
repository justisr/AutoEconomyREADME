         In extension to Mojang's TOS https://account.mojang.com/terms#commercial

NOTICE: This software is NOT maintained by Mojang nor is Mojang responsible for this software.

 AutoEconomy is in compliance with Mojang's commercial licensing, categorized as a "Mod" of
Mojang's server software. Specifically, "CraftBukkit", which is a reversed engineered copy of
that server software, and currently exists in conflict with Mojang's commercial terms. Bukkit
is a wrapper for that reversed engineered server. Consequently, and especially due to Mojang's
TOS stating that derivative software is only considered a mod if it does not contain a substantial
amount of their copyright content, that being, in this case, the reverse engineered CraftBukkit...
One must conclude that Bukkit does not qualify for the exceptions granted to mods, though Mojang
will have the final say, as specified in their commercial terms.

As quoted by Mojang's current TOS:
"- all rights (including copyright, trademark rights and related rights) in the Name, Brand, and 
Assets and any derivatives are and will remain owned by Mojang"

 Consequently, this software's license does not acknowledge the licensing of the the violating
CraftBukkit/Bukkit software as anything other Mojang's proprietary server software, as is most
reasonable given the terms that Mojang employs. Thus, this license is instead a compatible direct
extension of the license granted by Mojang for "Mods" for their server software.

 Usage licenses for this software are granted directly by the current maintainers of this software.
Usage licenses are non-transferable and can be revoked by the current maintainers of this software.
Usage licenses are refundable on an individual basis as allowed by the payment accepter.
Any usage licenses granted through any party other than past maintainers are non-valid.

You may not use this software in any way which would violate Mojang's most current TOS.

In addition, you may not:
- Remove this license from the packaging of any copies of this software
- Make this software accessible to anyone who does not also have a usage license for this software
- Reverse engineer and or decompile this software for any purpose other than as follows:
 a) Interoperability
 b) Bug testing
 c) Analytics
 d) Viewing resource files ending in the extension .txt, .hmff, .md, .json, or .yml
 e) As directly permitted by the current maintaining authors of this software
You may:
- Create derivative works of this software in compliance with the above terms
- Modify, redistribute, and resell any generated resource files ending in .txt, .hmff or .json
- Create multiple copies and run them on multiple servers in compliance with the above terms

 You maintain full responsibility for your copies of this software.
Downloading this software to a machine or uploading this software to a machine is permitted under
the condition that only you or licensed users will ever obtain access to those copies.

 In regards to the current maintainers of this software. The longest standing maintainer will
always have priority over newer maintainers. Only current maintainers have the right to
appoint new maintainers of this software and newer standing maintainers do not have the right
to remove longer standing maintainers.
Once a maintainer has resigned from their position or is removed by a longer standing maintainer
they cannot become a maintainer unless appointed by a current maintainer of this software, at
which point their standing will be reset to new.

In the case were all maintainers of this project have resigned, this license will cease to have
authority after one full year has elapsed. The licensing for this software will therefore be
reduced only to Mojang's current TOS, and redistribution of this software among other restricted
actions will be allowed so long as it is not forbidden by Mojang's TOS at the time.

CURRENT AND PAST MAINTAINERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USAGE OF
THIS OR ANY DERIVATIVE SOFTWARE. THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND MAKES NO GUARANTEES REGARDING
ITS RELIABILITY OR FUNCTIONALITY.

Access to a copy of this software is guaranteed for one full year after purchase and within
a month after being requested, so long as this license has not been violated by the holder.

Original and current maintainer,
