In the spirit of offering you the greatest possible freedom and control, this message config is formatted in JSON.
This allows you to alter the structure of the chat messages your players receive at the most fundimental level.
If you need a tutorial on how messages are structured, worry not, there's a complete wiki dedicated to the topic: http://wiki.vg/Chat
There's even an unofficial tool for automatically generating your JSON messages: https://www.minecraftjson.com/

This file will ignore all javascript comments as well as whitespace.
Comment out or delete any messages you don't want to send.

Messages that offer placeholder replacements will have comments which specify what placeholders are available for that message.

The message file version is stored in the config.hmff file.
Messages added in a newer file version than the one specified there but missing here will generate their defaults.
Once the new values are generated, the file version in the config.hmff will update to the latest version.
